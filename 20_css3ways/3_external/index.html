            <p>From all of us here, I want to wish you happy painting and God bless, my friends. If I paint something, I don't want to have to explain what it is. Use your imagination, let it go. Without washing the brush, I'm gonna go right into some Van Dyke Brown, some Burnt Umber, and a little bit of Sap Green.

            You don't have to be crazy to do this but it does help. Brown is such a nice color. Let that brush dance around there and play. Maybe there was an old trapper that lived out here and maybe one day he went to check his beaver traps, and maybe he fell into the river and drowned.

            This is a happy place, little squirrels live here and play. So often we avoid running water, and running water is a lot of fun. Let's have a little bit of fun today. We're trying to teach you a technique here and how to use it. Just think about these things in your mind and drop em' on canvas. Fluff it up a little and hypnotize it.
